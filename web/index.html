        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <br>

        <p>Hello I am Andrew, technology professional with 9+ years of progressive experience in MSP, federal, and small
            business</p>
        <br>

        </p>My technical skills and high level of customer service throughout my employment at an MSP company resulted
        in completion of over 12,000 customer tickets (the most in the MSP's history) and an overall personal NPS score
        of 93 rated
        by the clients I served. My expertise in Windows server administration and virtualization solutions (such as
        VMWare
        and Citrix VDA) were essential in supporting the Navy's IT infrastructure at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. I have
        been able to expand my skillset into the DevOps realm working with technologies such as Git, Google Cloud, and
        Docker in my current role as an IT Engineer at a game/software development company.</p>
