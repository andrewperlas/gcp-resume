            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <br>

            <p>Hello I am Andrew, systems administrator with 9+ years of professional experience managing and troubleshooting IT infrastructures. I have experience working for a Managed Service Provider (MSP) company in which we provided on-premises and cloud services for various small to medium sized businesses throughout Southern California. I was then able to obtain a top secret clearance to work as a contractor for the Navy as one of the lead systems administrators at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. I now work for a game and software development business as their sole IT Engineer.</p>
            <br>
            
            </p>My technical skills and high level of customer service throughout my employment at the MSP company resulted in the
            completion of over 12,000 customer tickets (the most in my MSP’s history) and an overall personal NPS score of 93 rated
            by the clients I serviced. My expertise in Windows server administration and virtualization technologies (such as VMWare
            and Citrix AVD) were essential in supporting the Navy's IT infrastructure at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Through my current IT Engineer role, I have expanded my skillset into the DevOps realm with technologies such as Git, Google Cloud, and Docker.</p>
