## Overview

I am kicking off my journey to learn more cloud and devops technologies by tackling [Forrest Brazeal's GCP Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/googlecloud/). Based on the outline of the challenge, this will improve my skills with Google Cloud, Git, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD (Github Actions), and APIs.
