## Overview

To level up my knowledge of cloud and devops technologies, I am tackling [Forrest Brazeal's GCP Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/googlecloud/). Based on the outline of the challenge, I will be developing skills in Google Cloud, Git, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD (Github Actions), and APIs.
